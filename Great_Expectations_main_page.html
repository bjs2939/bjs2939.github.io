        <h2>About the Program</h2>
        <p>The Great Expectations &amp; Next Steps Program is a set of nationwide courses designed to educate new and expectant parents about prenatal care, breastfeeding, labor and delivery preparation, toddler care, and essential life skills such as money management. Offered at no cost, these programs are funded by our generous community and ANPC partners.</p>

    <h2>Flexible Class Options</h2>
    <p>Classes can be attended in-person or virtually to accommodate diverse schedules and preferences. For parents who prefer a more personalized experience, one-on-one classes are available at the ANPC, and group classes are offered as well. Choose the format that works best for you!</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/bjs2939/Great-Expecations/blob/main/Great%20Exp%20-%20Virtual%20Option.pdf">Click here to learn more about using the Virtual Option!</a></p>

    <h2>Class Schedule</h2>
    <p>The Great Expectations Pregnancy Classes are held weekly, either in-person or virtually. Once the baby is born, parents transition to the Next Steps Parenting Program, which is also held weekly. As the child reaches six months of age, classes are provided every other week until the child turns two. If you need to earn more points, please let us know.</p>

    <h2>Engaging Learning Sessions</h2>
    <p>Sessions may include a variety of content such as videos, discussions, handouts, spiritual applications, and simple assignment sheets. Our goal is to make learning enjoyable and engaging.</p>

    <h2>Earn and Redeem ANPC Points</h2>
    <p>Earn points by participating in the program, completing assignments, referring friends, and more. Points can be used to "purchase" essential baby supplies like cribs, car seats, and other items in our Baby Boutique.</p>

    <h2>The Baby Boutique</h2>
    <p>Located at the ANPC, the Baby Boutique is exclusively for program participants. Use your earned points to purchase new and gently used items in our beautiful boutique.</p>

    <h2>When to Sign Up</h2>
    <p>Ideally, it's best to sign up for Great Expectations Pregnancy Classes during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, you can join at any point during your pregnancy. Parents with children aged two or younger are also welcome to sign up for Next Steps.</p>

    <h2>Father Involvement</h2>
    <p>Fathers are encouraged to participate in the program and earn their own points. They can also join our weekly Man up! Program for additional point-earning opportunities.</p>

    <h2>How to Sign Up</h2>
    <p>Contact us at (757) 787-1119, email us at <a href="mailto:pregnancycenter@yahoo.com">pregnancycenter@yahoo.com</a>, or visit the ANPC in person to register and get more information. We look forward to helping you on your parenting journey!</p>
